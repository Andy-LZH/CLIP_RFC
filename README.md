# CLIP + Residual Feature Connection

Residual Feature Connection aims to fuse the task-specific knowledge learned from the target domain and the original knowledge pre-trained from CLIP. We show that RFC can adapt pre-trained CLIP to downstream pathology tasks and achieve good performance with just a few annotated samples. Specifically, RFC achieves over 19% improvement on accuracy when only using 0.1% of labeled data in PCam with only 10 minutes of fine-tuning while running on a single RTX 2080Ti.
